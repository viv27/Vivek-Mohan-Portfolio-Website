                One thing I noticed about building websites in 2020: despite all the social networks and publishing
                platforms craving our content, our stories, and our attention, people are somehow still building
                personal websites. Over the course of the year, many of you have launched or relaunched your website. It
                indeed feels like the personal website is experiencing a little revival. <br> <br>

                To me, this comes as no surprise. The benefits of having your own personal site are enormous and
                appealing. As a creator, publishing on your own website might even be the single best thing you can do,
                both professionally and personally.
            </p>
            <h3>Your Voice</h3>
            <p>
                On your personal website, you own your work. You decide what and when to publish. You decide when to
                delete things. You are in control. Your work, your rules, your freedom. <br> <br>

                Your personal website is also a wonderful playground to tinker, prototype, experiment, explore, and
                learn about web standards and new technologies by experience. Want to improve your accessibility skills?
                Want to learn CSS Grid or try out variable fonts? Want to implement your first Service Worker or
                fine-tune the performance of your site? Your personal website is the perfect place for that! <br> <br>

                But the prime reason to have a personal website is in the name: it is your personal home on the web.
                Since its early days, the web has been about sharing information and freedom of expression. Personal
                websites still deliver on that promise. Nowhere else do you have that much freedom to create and share
                your work and to tell your personal story. It is your chance to show what you stand for, to be
                different, and to be specific. Your site lets you be uniquely you and it can be whatever you imagine it
                to be. <br> <br>

                So if you have a personal site, make sure to put in the work and attention to make it truly yours. Make
                it personal. Fine-tune the typography, add a theme switcher, or incorporate other quirky little details
                that add personality. As Sarah Drasner writes, you can feel it if a site is done with care and
                excitement. Those are the sites that are a joy to visit and will be remembered. <br> <br>
